## Shell Scripting First Experience

### Introduction

This repository contains my first shell scripting experience. I created a simple script to automate a tasks to calculate Automated Readability Index, and this README documents contains my experience, the challenges I faced, and what I learned during the process.

### My Experience

Learning with shell scripting was both exciting and challenging. Initially, I was unfamiliar with many of the commands and syntax used in shell scripts since shell scripting was a new concept to me. However, with some research and practice, I started to understand the basics for this I have refered youtube videos and along with online tutorials from javatpoint and tutorialspoint.

### Learning Strategy

Understanding Commands- One of the first things I learned was how to use basic shell commands like echo, mkdir, and date. Understanding how to combine these commands in a script was crucial.

   Scripting Syntax: Learning the syntax for shell scripting, such as using `'$(command)'` to execute a command and get its output, was an essential thing. I also learned about the importance of the shebang `(#!/bin/bash)` at the beginning of the script.

### Challenges Faced

Debugging: Debugging shell scripts can be soo tricky. I had to learn how to use `echo `statements effectively to track the flow of the script and identify where things were going wrong.
    
Permissions: I ran into issues with permissions when trying to execute my script. I learned how to use `chmod +x example_script.sh` to make the script executable.

### What I Learned From Shell Scripting

Basic Shell Commands: I now have a good understanding of basic shell commands and how to use them in scripts.

Script Structure: I learned how to structure a shell script, including using comments to make the script more readable.

Error Handling: Although basically, I started to understand the importance of handling errors and ensuring my script runs smoothly.

### Conclusion
Overall, my first experience with shell scripting was highly educational and make me to know the basic structure of a shell script. It provided me with a foundational understanding of how scripts can automate tasks and make working with the terminal more efficient. I look forward to exploring more advanced scripting techniques in the upcoming projects.
